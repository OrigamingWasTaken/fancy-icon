# Fancy Icon

Fancy Icon is a lightweight mod that let's you change your icon with one simple file!

## How?

Place your 1:1 power of 2 icon (ex: 64x64 or 32x32) inside your .minecraft with the name `icon.png`

That's all!

**If you use this mod in a modpack, you don't have to credit me as it's very simple.**
